Today, I finished the new design of ShoulderBracket.

I also made necessary modifications to the designs of Humerus and Radius. 

Now, I have an assembly of the main skeleton (ShoulderBracket, Humerus and Radius).

I started working on simulating the static structural response of this skeleton under its weight and tension of the cables.

Simulated the skeleton, with photopolymer vero assigned as material.
