Today, I continued studying contact modelling in Ansys. 

I also started defining appropriate contact conditions for the shafts and joint members (Humerus and Radius), so that the deformations at the shoulder and elbow joints could be evaluated more accurately. 

During the last testing of Wing10, the elbow joint dislocated a bit during 5 Hz flapping. For Wing11, I will use suitable contact modelling and dynamic simulations to predict possible harmful deformation during high frequency flapping, before physical testing.
