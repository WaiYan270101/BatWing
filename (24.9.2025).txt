As I have mentioned before, I will start to use in-context modelling so that different parts of the wing platform fit better. 

I started by checking the models of the servo motors.

I downloaded the model of the Dynamixel servo XL330_M077_T from the official website, so I will trust the accuracy of the model.

But I got the model of KST DS215MG from an unofficial website, so I checked the dimensions of the model and made necessary modifications.

Reviewed and updated the dimensions file of Wing10 (latest version). Deleted unused dimensions. The dimensions of servo motors are no longer necessary as in-context modelling is used.

The core components that will be used in in-context modelling (their dimensions will be reference for the dimensions of other parts)
- Platform
- XL330_M077_T
- KST DS215MG
- Humerus
- Radius
- ShoulderBracket
- Fingers

I will start thinking about designing a partial body for membrane attachment. The core dimensions of the partial body will still be referenced to the dimensions of above core parts.
