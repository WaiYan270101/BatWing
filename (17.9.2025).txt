Got the 3D printed Servo Brackets with stiffened Tube Holders. The Tube Holders are very stiff and expected to operate with negligible bending during the wing folding and extension. 

It turns out that FDM can print the small slots for the tube clips quite accurately. I printed one bracket with the small cable exit holes and the other without the holes. There is difficulty in removing the support material if the cable exits are printed. So, I decided that it is better to print without the cable exit and drill this hole later. I ordered a handheld electric drill and some drill bits. 

New Servo Brackets will be printed to replace the old ones and to test the existing platform again.

Started modifying the design of the Radius to make it suitable for printing using SLS or MJF. The portions for holding the tube clips will be printed using PolyJet. I started using 'in-context modelling', designing all the parts in one assembly to ensure better fit. 

I plan to finish modifying the designs of ShoulderBracket, Humerus, Radius and one Finger first to test printing with nylon PA12.
