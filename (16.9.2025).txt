Designing new Humerus and Radius, each separated into different portions to be printed using vero (PolyJet) and nylon PA12 (SLS or MJF).

Using split to create the separated parts as the children of the main part.

Modified KST_Servo horizontal holder to have strong tube holder columns. I am gonna try printing it using PLA (FDM), in one piece. Needs to find out if the slots for the tube clips could be printed accurately.
